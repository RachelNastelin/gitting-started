# Gitting to know you
Fill in the text below with your own answers to each question. Each person in your group should submit their answers in a separate commit, but all of your answers should appear together in the file. Please add your answers after the `>` character so your answers will appear as quotes in the rendered markdown. To make it clear who has written each response, please preface each answer with your first name. For example, if Jordan writes a response to the question "What is your favorite typographical symbol?" the line should read "> Jordan: My favorite typographical symbol is the octothorp."

Why are you taking this course?
> I'm a CS major.

Do you have any concerns about this course?
> Yeah, but it's nothing in particular. I'm just a lot less knowledgable about computers in general than most of the people in this class. I've taught myself a bunch of programming languages, but I didn't learn them all that well, and I certainly don't know anything about how computers actually work. 

Look over the course schedule page. Which scheduled topics look most interesting to you?
> Well, I don't really know what any of that stuff means. I'm pretty clueless. But I know what hard drives are, so I guess that looks the most interesting to me. Also, programming malloc sounds really hard but really cool. I tend to find most things interesting, so I bet I'll like whatever we're covering. 

Do you have any questions about the course?
> No.

Do you have any other questions for me?
> Not yet.
